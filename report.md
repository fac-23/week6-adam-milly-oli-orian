#### QA

- We approached writing tests with Cypress as thinking ahead :thinking_face: about how the user would navigate to different dynamic routes of the page :dancer: 

- A lot of debugging was done with good old fashioned `console.log()` and it's important to clean these out of the code for the final draft

---


- Using Next was definitely helpful to keep syntax errors from slowing down the progress of adding new code, as it displays errors in the terminal and also immediately browser without needing to open the browser console

---

#### DevOps

- Initial file set up whilst went smoothly but we did take a pause thinking about how ElephantSQL would be connected to our local files and whether we needed a backup init.sql file :thinking_face: Always a good idea! :bulb:

- Vercel is incredibly helpful as a web hosting service, that is made with Next. Helpful error logs when deployment breaks! 

---

#### UI/UX

For the structure of the page we used flexbox

- We planned to have a homepage that contains the all the products and functionality to filter/sort the products to allow the user to view the products they wanted. 

- Then we created seperate routes for each of the products using get static paths and displayed them in their own page.

- When we tried to use url for images from unsplash we were getting an error 

the fix:

---

- We also have a basket page where we wanted the products to be added in after the user clicks on the add to basket button. 

- We also added links on each of the pages so that the user can navigate through the website. (We used Link tag from next )

- We also gave a visual reference that the images can be clicked by changing the opacity and the mouse to a hand on hover.

### Learnings

+ getServerSide props versus getStatic props, integrating React with serverside operations
+ using different data structures as state (objects and arrays)

[Using loclastorage with React hooks](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-localstorage-react-hooks/)

---

Can also be done with `useEffect` in individual component

`useState` can be given a function as initial state

### Challenges

- Time management for all the features needed, we would've loved to have added the Social OAuth login so that users could login with their Github profile and have a basket of cupcakes just for them!
- Unclear Next Documentation, it was confusing which method can be used with client side or server side `getStaticProps` vs `getServerSideProps`
